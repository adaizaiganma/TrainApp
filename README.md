## A Train app that looks better than taiwan railway app

I found that the ux and ui of the twrw app is shit

so i create this for myself.

# Getting started
1. Download the app from release
2. Go to https://tdx.transportdata.tw/ and apply for an account.
   Would take up to 2-3 working days for them to verify.
   (cause im applying for an organization account, not sure if the verify step is neccecery)
3. Login and create a new api key.
4. Enter the api key in the setting page on the app.
